# Bay_Area_Climbing_Weather
Final project for Python for Programmers class (completed early 2015)

command line program that allows climbers to determine which local (Bay Area) climbing areas have the best conditions (lack of 
humidity, lack of percipitation).  the program allows users to create profiles stored in a sqlite3 database.  upon a request 
to run the weather function, the script will pull weather data for hard-coded locations using an open source weather api.
